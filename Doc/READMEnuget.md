Euclid is a 2D and 3D geometry library without dependencies. 
Written in F# and designed for use with F#. 
That means all types are immutable and functions are curried where appropriate.
It is mostly focused on creating and manipulating primitives such as 
Points, Vectors, Lines, Planes, Boxes, and Bounding boxes, and Polylines. 
For transformations there are Rotations, Quaternions, and 4x4 Matrices.

See [Euclid.Rhino](https://github.com/goswinr/Euclid.Rhino) for conversion to Rhino3D geometry.
