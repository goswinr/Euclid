// Design notes:
// The structs types in this file only have the constructors, the ToString override and operators define in this file.
// For structs that need a checked and unchecked constructor ( like unit vectors) the main 'new' constructor is marked obsolete.
// A 'create' and 'createUnchecked' static member is provided instead.
// All other members are implemented as extension members. see files in folder 'members'.
// This design however makes extension members unaccessible from see C#. To fix this all types and all members could be put into one file.
// The types would have to be marked as recursive. This file would be very large and probably have bad editor performance.

netstandard2.0 does not support [<IsByRefLike>] nor  [<IsReadOnly>]

[<IsByRefLike>] is another attribute.
We are talking a lot about passing value types using memory location addresses instead of doing deep copies.
Marking struct using this attribute is basically saying "I always want to pass this value by reference".
This of course comes with severe limitations: it cannot be boxed (moved to managed heap) and
for this reason it can never be captured by closures, implement interfaces or be used as field in classes or other non-by-ref structs.

In terms of F# this basically means that this kind of structs are used mostly for code that
is executed right away within the function body, with no computation expressions or other indirections.
This usually qualifies them to hot paths in our code, where CPU intensive work is expected and allocations
are not welcome, like:

for .. in loops - in fact many moderns .NET structures have special variants of GetEnumerator
that doesn't allocate any memory and is implemented as by-ref struct.
F# also understands that pattern - in fact you can define custom
GetEnumerator(): MyEnumerator method for your collection, with MyEnumerator - which can even be a ref struct - having two methods:

Current: 'item and
MoveNext: unit -> bool, and F# will automatically understand how to use it in loops.
You can see an example implementation of it here -
https://github.com/Horusiath/fsharp.core.extensions/blob/62b102e84325e89b0a6c4065b973936c11adee55/src/FSharp.Core.Extensions/Vec.fs#L147
it's a part of implementation of persistent vector data type,
similar to FSharpX persistent vector, but it's 4.5 times faster and not allocating anything on heap when executed in loops.
